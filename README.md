==========

Data analysis scripts for the Sr lab.

From now on, our data analysis scripts will be edited inside this repository. Make a symbolic link to these files from the Igor `User Procedures` folder.

## Basic git workflow

If you're making substantial changes, create a new branch before editing. Commit changes as you go along, and when you're done, merge the "development" branch back into master and sync to the github remote repository.
